# Action Service Worker Design

## Worker Service Usecases

### Message Processing
- ProcessInboundMessage
  - Handles stage 2 processing of received messages
  - Triggered by message queue events
  - Updates event repository with results

### Delivery Patterns
- HandlePushDelivery
  - Processes outbound push-based deliveries
  - Manages delivery attempts and retries
  - Records delivery metrics

- HandlePullDelivery
  - Manages pull-based content retrieval
  - Handles polling and content processing
  - Updates delivery status

- HandleBatchDelivery
  - Processes batched content delivery
  - Manages batch item processing
  - Tracks partial completion status

### Monitoring & Metrics
- TrackDeliveryMetrics
  - Records delivery attempts
  - Tracks success/failure rates
  - Maintains timing metrics

- MonitorStreamHealth
  - Tracks stream processing health
  - Records error rates
  - Monitors processing durations

- CollectProtocolMetrics
  - Gathers protocol-specific metrics
  - Tracks protocol performance
  - Monitors connection status

## Message Queue Integration

### Queue Types
1. Inbound Message Queue
   - Receives webhook payloads
   - Triggers ProcessInboundMessage

2. Delivery Queue
   - Manages outbound deliveries
   - Supports different delivery patterns
   - Handles retries and failures

3. Monitoring Queue
   - Collects metrics
   - Processes health checks
   - Lower priority than main queues

### Worker Configuration
- Configurable concurrency per queue
- Separate worker pools by function
- Health check endpoints
- Resource usage monitoring

## Error Handling
- Retry policies per queue
- Dead letter queues
- Error event recording
- Alert triggering

## Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of workers
- Queue partitioning
- Resource allocation strategies
- Load balancing
