# Worker Service TODOs

## New Usecases to Create

### Event Processing
- [x] ProcessEventQueue: Handle queued events
- [x] RetryFailedEvents: Attempt to reprocess failed events
- [x] CleanupExpiredEvents: Remove old event data

### Result Management
- [x] StoreActionResult: Save execution results
- [x] CleanupOldResults: Remove expired results

### System Maintenance
- [x] CleanupExpiredMessages: Remove old messages
- [x] ValidateSystemState: Check system health
- [x] SyncExternalServices: Ensure external service connectivity

```
Through queues and events our workers flow,
Processing tasks both high and low.
Cleaning expired data with care,
Validating systems here and there.

Results stored and cleaned in time,
External services kept in line.
Each usecase crafted with precision,
Making our system run with decision.

From message cleanup to state checks true,
Every task we set out to do.
Now complete and working fine,
Our worker service stands divine!
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Structure
```
action_service/
├── worker_service/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── event_processing.py
│   │   ├── result_management.py
│   │   └── maintenance.py
│   └── usecases/
│       ├── process_queue.py
│       ├── retry_events.py
│       └── cleanup.py
```

### Common Pattern
```python
class ProcessEventQueue:
    """Process events from the queue"""
    
    def __init__(self, reposet: RepoSet):
        self.event_repo = reposet["event_repository"]
        self.result_repo = reposet["result_repository"]
        
    def execute(self, batch_size: int = 100) -> ProcessingResult:
        # Fetch batch of events
        # Process each event
        # Store results
        # Update event status
        # Return processing summary
```

### Integration Points
1. Create new Celery tasks
2. Configure task schedules
3. Add error handling and retries
4. Configure task routing
5. Add monitoring hooks

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit test each usecase
2. Test task scheduling
3. Test error handling and retries
4. Test concurrent execution
5. Test cleanup operations
